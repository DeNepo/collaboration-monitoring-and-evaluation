# Workflow Documentation

Our workflow in the iTalanta "Discover" program is designed to be efficient and structured. It involves the following key aspects

- [Workflow Documentation](#workflow-documentation)
  - [Branch-Naming Guidelines](#branch-naming-guidelines)
  - [Commit Guidelines](#commit-guidelines)
  - [Pull Requests (PRs)](#pull-requests-prs)
  - [PR Description Template](#pr-description-template)

## Branch-Naming Guidelines

Branches in our workflow should be named following a specific convention:

- Include the name name of the issue your working on.
- Include the reference number of the issue related to the branch.

For example, if you are working on a feature related to issue `fix inifinity scroll` with reference number `42`, your branch name could be `fix-inifinity-scroll-#42`.

## Commit Guidelines

We use conventional commits with emojis from Gitmoji to keep our commit messages organized and informative. Each commit should have a clear prefix emoji and a concise message describing the changes made.

## Pull Requests (PRs)

When creating pull requests, it's important to include in it's title an emoji, a description, and a reference number to the corresponding issue. This helps in quickly understanding the purpose of the PR and its relation to the project.

## PR Description Template

To ensure consistency and completeness in PR descriptions, we provide a template that should be used when creating PRs. The template helps you include essential information about the changes made, the problem solved, and any other relevant details.

In addition to these documentation guidelines, always follow the workflow and collaboration conventions taught in the program. This structured approach helps us maintain a high level of collaboration and ensures that your contributions are well-received by the community.

By adhering to these workflow guidelines, you'll not only learn valuable software development practices but also contribute effectively to open-source projects during your time in the iTalanta "Discover" program. We encourage you to ask questions, seek guidance from your mentors, and actively participate in the program to make the most of this learning opportunity.
